GITHUB TEAM STRUCTURE PLAN FOR SECURITY

üîê Access Levels:

1. OWNER (You)
- Full access to everything: settings, secrets, deploy keys
- Only you should have this role

2. MAINTAINER (1 DevOps or Lead Developer only)
- Access to pull requests, CI/CD, and secrets (read-only)
- Cannot transfer ownership or delete repo

3. CONTRIBUTOR (Developers)
- Can only push to branches and make pull requests
- No access to GitHub Actions secrets or production deployment keys

4. VIEWER (Interns, testers)
- Read-only access to code, cannot push or fork
- Used for monitoring or reviewing only

üõ°Ô∏è Security Rules:
- Set branch protection: main/master must pass checks before merge
- Disable force pushes
- Enable 2FA for all team members
- Use CODEOWNERS file for reviewing critical folders like `/backend/settings/`, `/frontend/api/`, etc.

‚úÖ Tips:
- Keep the repo PRIVATE
- Use GitHub Secrets for `.env` values ‚Äî never hardcode them
- Rotate team access every 90 days
